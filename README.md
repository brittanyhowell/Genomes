### Summary:

This repo has a lot of bash in it. It has three components, as evident by those three folders. ThesisPlotScripts is full of scripts that take my reams of data tables and plots and assembles them into formatted TeX files for inclusion into my honours thesis. alignToPlotScripts and phoenixAlign-Coverage both contain scripts which use tools to set up STAR alignments and process the output. They go from alignment to coverage plots. phoenixAlign-Coverage is basically identical to alignToPlotScripts except for the fact that scripts are written for different machines (VM/Mac vs phoenix.)
